# Data Analyst Portfolio

A portfolio of my work done thus far as a data analyst fellow.

We have the All Star Draft, We're Up All Night to Get Data, and Case Study Tableau Projects (.twbx)

In addtion to a Python case study, we also have the Python-created dataset and plotting for We're Up All Night to Get Data, labeled as Get Lucky (.ipynb, .py)

Examples of my work programming with and presenting on SQL can also be found under SQL Case Study (.zip, .pptx)

Finally, we have examples of some financial analysis performed using Excel (.xlsx)

All in all the projects showcase skills in Python, SQL, Tableau and Excel, as well as hands-on experience using Spotify's Web API.
